You may use the authn.io project under the terms of the 
New BSD License (3-clause).

The BSD License is recommended for most projects. It is simple and easy to 
understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with the
authn.io project.

NOTE: The use of this project under the New BSD License does not grant a
license for Bedrock (the applications server that authn.io runs
on top of). A Bedrock license may be acquired via Digital Bazaar:
